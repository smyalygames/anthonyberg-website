description: I might as well start out a blog.
---

This is my first post, I thought it was about time to actually start it.
Now that I have updated this website to Nextra v4, it is about time that I actually
start to provide some content for the blog.

What am I going to do with my blog? I think the direction I would head in with it
is whenever I feel like I struggled doing something, and learnt how to do it well,
I would actually provide a guide on it, just in case someone else would find it interesting.
Or maybe just an interesting topic that I found during my studies, as I am currently
working with HPCs.

But hopefully it will not be too long before the next real blog post comes out!
