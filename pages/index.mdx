# Anthony Berg

Hey, welcome to my website! :D

I'm Anthony, and I enjoy working with computers, be it from developing on my own projects,
or just using Linux on my PCs or setting up my own personal servers.

For my day to day life, I am currently in my 1<sup>st</sup> year of my Master's at OsloMet, studying
Applied Computer and Information Technology, specialising in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific
Computing.
I have also completed BSc Computer Science at Newcastle University.

I have a few open source projects that I have worked on that you can find in my [portfolio](/projects).
