# Projects

Here are some of my projects that I have worked on


## Flight Sim on Linux

A website made with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) in Next.js 14, which has guides for running flight simulators and
installing addons for them on Linux.

Take a look at the website: [www.flightsimonlinux.com](https://www.flightsimonlinux.com/)

A Discord Bot used on a server with over 22,000 members.

Made using the [Sapphire Framework](https://www.sapphirejs.dev/), in TypeScript, which is open source under
the GPL v3 license.
I set up the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/veganhacktivists/arabot), alongside maintaining the repository and
the server, which runs on Debian Server.
