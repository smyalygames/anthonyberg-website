# Projects

Here are some of my projects that I have worked on


## Flight Sim on Linux

A website made with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) in Next.js 14, which has guides for running flight simulators and
installing addons for them on Linux.

Take a look at the website: [www.flightsimonlinux.com](https://www.flightsimonlinux.com/)

An Android app to show and search what E Numbers are vegan.

The app is currently in development, but it is made with [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/) using Kotlin.

Once the app has matured more, the code will be open sourced and released to the Google Play.

## ARA Bot

A Discord Bot used on a server with over 22,000 members.

Made using the [Sapphire Framework](https://www.sapphirejs.dev/), in TypeScript, which is open source under
the GPL v3 license.
I set up the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/veganhacktivists/arabot), alongside maintaining the repository and
the server, which runs on Debian Server.
